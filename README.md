# projlib.client
A utility library for projects of mine. Its current primary (and only) purpose is updating.

Check out [the server side code](https://github.com/CoolandonRS/projlib.server), too.

Both will be pushed onto nuget once they become more feature-complete and after a small amount of testing.
